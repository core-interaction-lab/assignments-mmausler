                    It's a hot summer on <span class="input-value" data-input="input-1"></span>, 
                    a small community whose 
                    main business is its beaches. When new Sheriff 
                    <span class="input-value" data-input="input-2"></span> 
                    discovers the remains of a <span class="input-value" data-input="input-3"></span> 
                    attack victim, his first inclination 
                    is to close the beaches to swimmers. This doesn't sit well with 
                    Mayor Larry Vaughn and several of the local businessmen. Brody backs 
                    down to his regret as that weekend a young boy is killed by the predator. 
                    The dead boy's mother puts out a bounty on the shark and Amity is 
                    soon swamped with amateur hunters and fisherman hoping to cash in 
                    on the reward. A local fisherman with much experience 
                    <span class="input-value" data-input="input-4"></span> sharks, 
                    Quint, offers to hunt down the creature for a hefty fee. Soon Quint, 
                    Brody and Matt Hooper from the <span class="input-value" data-input="input-5"></span> 
                    are at sea hunting the Great White shark. As Brody succinctly surmises after their first 
                    encounter with the creature, they're going to need a bigger boat.
